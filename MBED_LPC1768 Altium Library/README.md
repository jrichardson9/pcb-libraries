# MBED_LPC1768 Altium Library

The attached files are an Altium integrated library for the ARM MBED_LPC1768. 

In order to use the library please download MBED_LPC1768.LibPkg, PCB_MBED.PcbLib and SCHEMATIC_MBED.SchLib, and place in the same folder. Then open MBED_LPC1768.LibPkg. This can then be modified as required for your specific application (increased/decrease pad size or add extra markings) and compiled, or just compiled and used straight away if no changes are needed.

There are also some images included in this folder of the PCB recently produced using the component library.

The included 3D step model was obtained from https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/markinbahrain/mbed.zip, designed by one of Mark Watts students Hasan Rahdi at Bahrain Polytechnic, so thanks for this.
